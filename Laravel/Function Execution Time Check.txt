In Minute =>


You can use microtime(true) with following manners:

Put this at the start of your php file:

//place this before any script you want to calculate time
$time_start = microtime(true);

// your script code goes here

// do something

Put this at the end of your php file:

// Display Script End time
$time_end = microtime(true);

//dividing with 60 will give the execution time in minutes other wise seconds
$execution_time = ($time_end - $time_start)/60;

//execution time of the script
echo '<b>Total Execution Time:</b> '.$execution_time.' Mins';

It will output you result in minutes.
